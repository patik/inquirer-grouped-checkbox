## General guidelines

- Never ask: "Would you like me to make this change for you?". Just do it. Keep going until you're finished.
- Use pnpm for package management and running scripts. Do not use npm or yarn.
- Use PascalCase for component names, interfaces, and type aliases
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants
- Prefer try/catch blocks for async operations instead of .then()/.catch()
- Write JSDoc comments for all functions, classes, and complex code blocks
- Write unit tests for all new functionality and bug fixes
